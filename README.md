# Open WebUI Desktop

**Status: Early Development, WIP, Unstable.**  

Open WebUI Desktop is a desktop application for [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), a popular self-hosted LLM WebUI. Built using Tauri 2, it incorporates Svelte-based front-end code from Open WebUI to deliver a seamless desktop experience.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Python 3.11** (configured for a virtual environment)
- **Node.js** with a package manager (e.g., npm or deno)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm run tauri dev` or `deno task tauri dev` to initiate the first-time build process (this may take some time).
3. Clone the [Open WebUI repository](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).
4. Follow the Open WebUI instructions to start **only the backend development server**.
5. Once the app is built, launch it. You should see the Open WebUI setup screen.
